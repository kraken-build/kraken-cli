# Welcome to the Kraken CLI documentation!

  [Kraken]: https://pypi.org/project/kraken-build/

Kraken CLI is the command-line interface for the [Kraken][] build system. 

It's responsibilities are

* executing build scripts to generate a build graph
* allow you to inspect and execute tasks in the build graph
* manage a separate Python virtual environment with build time dependencies to ensure consistent, repeatable builds (see [Build Environment](./buildenv.md))
